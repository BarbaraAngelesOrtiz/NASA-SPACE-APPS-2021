## BACKEND

### 1) BRIEF AEROSPACE PHYSICAL THEORY ‚≠ê
A two-line element set (TLE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the epoch. Using a suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy.

The TLE data representation is specific to the simplified perturbations models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest.

The TLE format is a de facto standard for distribution of an Earth-orbiting object's orbital elements.

### 2) IMPLEMENTATION ‚úÖ
We use Orbit Predictor: is a Python library to propagate orbits of Earth-orbiting objects (satellites, ISS, FENGYUN-1C, etc) using TLE (Two-Line Elements set), based on the SGP4 implementation.

The following spatial tests were analyzed: FENGYUN-1C, COSMOS-970, RUBIN-8 & PSLV R / B, RUBIN-4 & SL-8 R / B, MICROSAT-R DEB and ISS. The input .tle files were pulled from Celestrak.

And as a result, we can determine for a given instant of time t:

Latitude, Longitude and Height.
Its position at that instant t.
Position, speed and mistake made.
Determine if it is possible to observe this object in our country.
All the results were applied to our country Argentina (ARG).

### 1) IMPLEMENTATION ‚úÖ

We use WorldWind: is an open source virtual globe API. WorldWind allows developers to quickly and easily create interactive visualizations of 3D globe, map and geographical information.

Because WorldWind is completely open source, extending the API is simple and easy to do.
